What is Concurrency
Concurrency is the concept of executing two or more tasks at the same time (in parallel). Tasks may include methods (functions), parts of a program, or even other programs. With current computer architectures, support for multiple cores and multiple processors in a single CPU is very common. The two main concurrency concepts are processes and threads.

What is a Thread
A thread is a thread of execution in a program. The Java Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently. Each JVM server can have a maximum of 256 threads to run Java applications.

What is a collection in Java
Java collection keeps data elements in memory at run time. Java collections provide high-performance and high-quality data structures and algorithms, They can increase the speed of traversing data or finding specific values in a data collection.

What is a stream in Java
Stream is functional in nature. Operations are performed on a Collection of elements. Operations performed on a stream does not modify it's source. For example, filtering a Stream obtained from a collection produces a new Stream without the filtered elements, rather than removing elements from the source collection.

Jackson (API)
 
In computing, Jackson is a high-performance JSON processor for Java. Its developers extol the combination of fast, correct, lightweight, and ergonomic attributes of the library.[1][2]
